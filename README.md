# dotsnew
my (hopefully) up to date i3-gaps dotfiles, now based around pywal and polybar.
also my terminal of choice is a slightly modified version of [luke smith's st fork](https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/st). maybe i'll share my exact config later.

(thank you spectacle btw)

## configs for:
- i3-gaps wm
- polybar
- rofi
- fish
- compton
- neovim

## installation
i'll give better instructions later, but for now copy the contents of my config folder to yours and change the config.toml file found at config/polybar/ if you want to display the weather.
this rice is entirely based around the awesome pywal tool, so make sure to use that
